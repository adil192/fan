# Just Fan Noise's Privacy Policy

Just Fan Noise is a white noise app developed by Adil Hanney that simulates the sound of a running fan.

Just Fan Noise may hereafter be referred to as "the app".

## Data Collection

No data is collected or shared by Just Fan Noise.

On Android, iOS, and macOS, the app does not request internet permissions at all.
Other platforms may not have a permission system, but the app still does not make any network requests.

The app stores your in-app preferences such as the oscillation toggle and speed setting locally on your device.
This data is not collected or shared with myself nor any third parties.

## Deletion of Data

The data stored on your device can be deleted by uninstalling the app.

There is no data collected or stored elsewhere, so there is no additional data to delete.

## Source code

The source code for Just Fan Noise is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adil192/fan)

Assets used by the app are licensed separately to the source code. You can find asset license details in the app on your device, or as documented in the source code repository.
